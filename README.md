🌙 Somnus

Evidence-Based Sleep Optimization for the Circadian Mind.

Somnus is a high-end, privacy-focused sleep calculator designed to help users wake up refreshed by synchronizing their alarms with natural human sleep cycles. Unlike standard alarm clocks, Somnus leverages the "90-Minute Rule" and adjustable sleep onset latency to minimize sleep inertia.

✨ Features

The 90-Minute Engine: Calculates optimal wake and sleep windows based on NREM/REM cycles.

Sleep Onset Latency: Customizable "Time to fall asleep" setting (Defaulted to 15 mins) for surgical precision.

Power Nap Suite:

NASA Power Nap (20m): Instant alertness boost without entering deep sleep.

Full Cycle (90m): Complete mental reset for serious recovery.

Chronotype-Ready UI: A "Dark Mode First" interface designed with deep indigos and violets to minimize blue light exposure before bed.

Evidence-Based Insights: Dynamic tips based on clinical sleep hygiene research.

Zero-Dependency Core: Built with a single-file architecture for maximum portability and speed.

🔬 The Science

Human sleep isn't a linear progression; it occurs in cycles. A typical cycle lasts roughly 90 minutes.

Waking up during the middle of a cycle (especially Stage 3 Deep Sleep) causes Sleep Inertia—that groggy, disoriented feeling that can last for hours. Somnus uses the formula:

$$T_{wake} = T_{sleep} + (n \times 90) + T_{latency}$$

Where $n$ is the number of cycles (ideally 5 or 6) and $T_{latency}$ is the time it takes you to actually drift off.

🚀 Getting Started

Somnus is built as a single-file SPA (Single Page Application). There are no build steps required.
